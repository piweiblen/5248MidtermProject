	One mathematical idea I am curious to know more about as a result of taking this class is some of the specifics of the ciphertext only attack of the vigenere cipher. Specifically, when using the method of checking the index of coincidence to find the length of the key, exactly how long does the ciphertext need to be for this to be effective? A similar but simpler thought is: how long does a substitution cipher ciphertext need to be for frequency analysis to be effective?
	This interests me from a statistics perspective as I would be interested to see for messages of length X what percentage of the time do these sorts of frequency attacks yield the correct plaintext. I would be interested to see the graph of X. As a programmer, I might see if I can get my hands on a database of thoundsands or more phrases of various lengths, and try to run a Monte Carlo type simulation to get a feel for these graphs.


	My strengths as a mathematician definitely lie in proof writing. I had rigor drilled into me early and at this point the structure and language of proof writing comes rather naturally. I am usually pretty quick to pick up on concepts as well, which allows me the joy of picking up on new math with little frustration.
	What I need improvement on is retention. I definitely find myself refrencing definitions, textbooks, and other sources a lot when doing homework and writing proofs. And while I recognize this is always the case for near everyone, for me it is to the point where it often slows me down significantly. To improve on this, I believe that repetition is the key. Doing more practice problems outside of homework, and maybe even whipping up some flash cards could be a very worthwhile investment.
